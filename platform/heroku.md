# Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. See [here](./platform/heroku.md) for more information about Heroku.

## Pricing

Unfortunately there is no offer for non profit or education as you will see in the [pricing page](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) but you can leverage the Free option for a sandbox mode.
