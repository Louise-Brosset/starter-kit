# Jira

[Atlassian JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is built for every member of your software team to plan,
track, and release great software.
The good thing is that Atlassian server software products, and Atlassian-made Apps are free for use by registered non-profit charitable organizations that cannot otherwise purchase Atlassian products. The Atlassian Cloud service is available for registered non-profit charitable organizations for 75% off commercial prices.
