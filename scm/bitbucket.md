# Bitbucket

[Atlassian Bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket) is more than just Git code management. Bitbucket gives teams one place to plan projects, collaborate on code, test, and deploy.
The good thing is that Atlassian server software products, and Atlassian-made Apps are free for use by registered non-profit charitable organizations that cannot otherwise purchase Atlassian products. The Atlassian Cloud service is available for registered non-profit charitable organizations for 75% off commercial prices.
